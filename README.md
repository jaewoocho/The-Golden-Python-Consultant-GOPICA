# The-Golden-Python-Consultant-GOPICA
The Golden Python Consultant : G.O.P.I.C.A = (Golden Operating Python Intelligence Consulting Assistant)

For my project of "The Golden Python Consultant : GOPICA", it will be a python project that will analyze gold price data from the web and advise users like an consultant. The concept of the project comes from JARVIS (Just a Rather very Intelligent System), an artificial intelligence consultant from the marvel movie series of "Ironman", who consults Ironman after anaylzing data. The project name of GOPICA is a reference to JARVIS as it will analyze gold price data and consult(advise) the user. The concept of past(time series graphs), present(real time gold price), and future(financial news and sentiment analysis) will be used throughout the program to consult the user with deciding on buying gold.

GOPICA, the golden python consultant, will consult users that are considering on investing on gold. GOPICA will extract gold price data trends from 1950 to 2020 from a csv file and sort the data. After the gold data is sorted and analyzed, data tables and time series graphs of the data trends will be represented. GOPICA will represent a timeseries graph of data from 1950 to 2020, a daily comparison of high and low price ends from 2011 to 2020, and a daily percentage change of average gold prices from 2011 to 2020 that shows an interactive trend of data. After the data trends are displayed, GOPICA will extract real time gold prices and display the data for the user. GOPICA will also extract three different financial news titles and autogenerated summaries from Bloomberg, a professional financial news source, to display for the users to read as the current financial news are a indicator for the future of gold prices and investments. The financial news will also be labled by a sentiment analyzer as the user may be unsure if the summary of the financial news is either positive or negative. Finally, GOPICA will incorporate the real time gold prices and sentiment analysis from the financial news into an final algorithm to advise the user whether or not to invest in gold.

For thousands of years ago to the current modern times, gold has been an universal sign of wealth and belief. Gold has been reliable asset that brings great influences to the world, such as the California Gold Rush in 1848. This brought several barriers in finding datasets and APIs as companies were sensitive in sharing their data(and APIs) related to gold data trends. However, in the end, I finally found the gold data that I needed to create a consultant that will analyze gold data trends and advise users on their decision to buy gold.
